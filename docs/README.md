# BaaStream ‚öïÔ∏è ‚Äî Healthcare API Risk & Compliance Scanner

Transform reactive compliance into proactive risk prevention. BaaStream continuously scans your APIs, infrastructure-as-code, and logs against healthcare-grade controls (HIPAA, HITRUST, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, FHIR, PCI-DSS) to catch issues before they become costly incidents or failed audits.

> Legal note: BaaStream identifies technical risks and control gaps. It does not provide legal advice or guarantee compliance outcomes. More information read: www.baastream.com/legal

## üíº Executive Summary
- Reduce breach and audit failure risk with automated scanning and clear remediation.
- Shorten audits from weeks to days with evidence-ready reporting (JSON, CSV, PDF, summaries).
- Integrate in hours, not months: CLI-first, CI/CD plugins, and dashboard upload-ready.
- Outcome-focused: fewer incidents, faster audits, lower compliance cost.

---

## üß∞ What BaaStream Does
- Scans infrastructure configs, CI/CD workflows, and logs for misconfigurations, missing controls, and PHI/PII exposure risks.
- Maps findings to frameworks (HIPAA, HITRUST, SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, FHIR, PCI-DSS) with remediation guidance.
- Generates executive-friendly reports and engineering-ready action lists.
- Extensible via plugins (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform) and custom rules.

Who it‚Äôs for: CTO/CISO/VP Eng at healthtech, payors/providers, digital health, and any API-driven product handling PHI/PII or payment data.

## üè• Case Studies (Illustrative)
- Healthcare startup (50 employees): avoided SOC 2 remediation delay; saved ~$450K and 6 months
- Mid-size health system: early PHI exposure detection; saved ~$2.7M and avoided sanctions
- API platform (200 employees): PCI checks maintained enterprise deals; saved ~$1.1M

## üÜö Competitive Landscape (High-Level)
| Option | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic open-source scanners | Free; basic checks | Limited healthcare depth; no audit-ready outputs |
| Traditional GRC suites | Governance workflows | Slow to implement; weak code/log-level checks |
| BaaStream | Healthcare rules + CI/CD + logs + reports | Purpose-built; complements (not replaces) GRC |

BaaStream often runs alongside your SIEM and GRC to close the technical control gap.

## üß™ End-to-End Workflow (Under the Hood)

- **1) CLI parses inputs and flags**
  - Reads flags like `-rules`, `-format`, `-severity`, `-tags`, `-type`, `-log-format`, `-custom-rules`, `-historical`, `-login`, `-setup-dashboard`, etc.
  - Supports listing rules and plugins, showing help/version, and authentication commands.

- **2) Engine initialization**
  - Creates the compliance engine (`engine.NewEngine()`), which instantiates the rule engine, scanner, and loads built-in plugins.
  - Plugins are loaded and available for info/extension; scanning uses the rule engine as the primary path.

- **3) Rules loading and selection**
  - If `-rules` is a directory/file: loads YAML rules via `LoadRules`.
  - If `-rules` is a specific ID (e.g., `AUDIT-001`): loads all, then selects only that rule.
  - Optional filters:
    - `-severity` to include only rules of that severity.
    - `-tags` to include only rules matching tags (e.g., `hipaa,gdpr`).

- **4) Input discovery and scan type detection**
  - Determines scan type: `auto|config|logs`. Auto uses extension heuristics.
  - If a directory: walks files matching extensions for the scan type.
  - If a single file: proceeds directly.

- **5) Log parsing (for -type logs)**
  - Detects format automatically (Apache, Nginx, JSON, structured, mixed, or custom).
  - Parses into structured entries; if parsing fails or no fields extracted, falls back to scanning raw text content.

- **6) Scanning and rule evaluation**
  - For each data item, builds a `ScanContext` and evaluates every loaded rule.
  - Rich condition operators supported: `equals`, `contains`, `in`, `regex`, comparison ops, `exists/not_exists`, nested fields via dot notation, and `and/or` logical groups.
  - Produces `pass/fail/error` results with severity, category, message, remediation, and data context.

- **7) Output generation**
  - Formats: `json`, `csv`, `pdf` (text-style summary currently), or `summary`.
  - Summary/analytics can incorporate `-historical` data for trend analysis.

- **8) Analytics and dashboards (when summary/analytics)**
  - Computes risk scores (overall, by severity/category/framework) and recommendations.
  - Generates a compliance dashboard object with top risks, quick wins, compliance rate, next scan suggestion, and trends.

- **9) Dashboard authentication and upload (optional)**
  - If not disabled (`-disable-upload` absent), validates authentication and plan limits.
  - Authentication options:
    - Firebase (browser PKCE or device code fallback; refresh tokens supported; mock mode for testing).
    - Legacy email/password (deprecated path retained for compatibility).
  - If valid and plan allows uploads, sends results + metadata to the dashboard API.
  - Graceful degradation: scan never fails solely due to auth/upload issues.

- **10) Exit codes**
  - `0`: all checks passed
  - `1`: one or more checks failed
  - `2`: an error occurred during scanning

### Typical Run (Putting it Together)
1) Load rules (or a specific rule ID), apply optional filters.
2) Detect scan type and enumerate inputs.
3) Parse logs (if applicable), with automatic format detection and fallback.
4) Evaluate all rules against each input; collect results.
5) Generate desired output format; optionally compute analytics and trends.
6) Validate auth and plan; if eligible, upload results to the dashboard.
7) Return appropriate exit code for CI/CD gating.
