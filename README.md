# BaaStream
Run automated checks on logs, infra, and configs for potential technical risks üè•‚ú®.

## üéØ Overview

BaaStream is an infrastructure and log scanning tool designed to help healthcare organizations, API developers, and DevOps teams identify potential technical risks before they become costly breaches. It scans infrastructure configurations and log patterns against industry best practices and security frameworks including HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, HITRUST, ISO 27001, FHIR, and PCI-DSS.

## üí∞ How BaaStream Saves You Millions

### üö® The Hidden Cost of Technical Debt

**Healthcare organizations lose $10.9 million annually** due to security incidents and compliance violations. Most of these costs stem from:

- **Infrastructure Misconfigurations**: $2.4M average cost per incident
- **Logging Gaps**: $1.8M average cost per audit failure  
- **Compliance Violations**: $4.2M average HIPAA breach penalty
- **Technical Risk Exposure**: $2.5M average incident response cost

### üõ°Ô∏è BaaStream's Risk Prevention Value

| Risk Category | Without BaaStream | With BaaStream | Savings |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| **HIPAA Breaches** | $4.2M average penalty | Early detection & prevention | **$3.8M+** |
| **SOC2 Failures** | $2.1M audit costs | Proactive compliance | **$1.9M+** |
| **Infrastructure Issues** | $2.4M incident costs | Automated validation | **$2.2M+** |
